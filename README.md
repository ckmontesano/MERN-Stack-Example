# MERN-Stack-Example
This is a working example of a MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS). Please note that it assumes that you have a MongoDB local environment setup with a database called **PeopleDirectory** with a collection named **users**.

The **users** collection should contain only records matching the following schema:
```
{
  name: String,
  email_address: String
}
```
